Definition:
Simple Interest is the interest calculated only on the original principal amount
 for the entire duration of the loan or investment. It does not compound, meaning
 interest is not earned on previously earned interest.

Formula:
Simple Interest=P×R×T100
Simple Interest=100P×R×T​

Where:

    PP = Principal amount (initial sum of money)

    RR = Rate of interest per annum (in %)

    TT = Time (in years)

using multiple inheritance

2) Compound Interest

Definition:
Compound Interest is the interest calculated on the principal amount and also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. This means interest is earned on interest.



In the program:

    Class CompoundInterest inherits from Principal and calculates compound interest.

    Class TotalAmount inherits from CompoundInterest and calculates the total amount payable (principal + compound interest).

If you want me to explain inheritance concepts in these programs as well, just ask!
